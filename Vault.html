      <!-- Block7: building a vault that requires three mathematical calculations to generate the three codes in a combination -->

<!--Step 1: IN HTML-- Created html and js files and used the code above(LINE 6) to link them together
    Step 2: IN JS-- Created 3 const variables(x,y,z) and for each one I created an equation to equal the deired combinations. Used different operators for each variable to calculate each combination.(LINE 1,2,3)
    Step 3: IN JS-- Created a alert message to pop-up in the browser displaying the vaults combination (LINE 5)
    Step 4: IN JS-- Using ${} I was able to insert each variables combination within the alert message(LINE 5)
